        "The table detection accuracy is crucial for successful extraction of data from images. Inaccurate table structure detection and boundary detection lead to improper identification of rows, columns, and cells, resulting in incorrect cell cropping. This misalignment causes data loss, as portions of the table content may be excluded or wrongly classified into cells. To resolve this, improving the accuracy of table structure detection would enhance the precision of cell boundary identification. By refining the model’s ability to detect the exact position of rows, columns, and table headers, the output CSV file can be extracted more accurately. Approaches to improve table detection accuracy could include:\n",
